# supdup
Slight modification of Björn Victor's supdup to make it work with OpenBSD

This code was taken from (Björn Victor's excellent site)[http://victor.se/bjorn/its/] about the (Incompatible Timesharing System)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System]. I added small changes to make it compile on OpenBSD.
